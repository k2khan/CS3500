2./ If we have eight bits, we need one more bit for the parity bit. So, we will have 9 bits that will be sent in total.

4./ Yes, the parity bit catches all errors when a single bit is flipped.

5./ No, the parity bit doesn't catch any errors when more than one bit is flipped.

6./ The parity bit method is suitable for single bit detection only.

7./ 38 bytes of overhead.

8./ The overall transmisison would be 138 bytes. 38/138 =  27.5% of overhead.

9./ The overall transmission would be 153 bytes, with 2.5% overhead.
